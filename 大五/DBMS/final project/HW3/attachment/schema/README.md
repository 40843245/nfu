# Schema
## Intro 
The schema of the database refers all tables' structure in specific database.
## NOTICE
Since I have developed a project with mongodb compress (a kind of non-relational DBMS), 

for newest info, I just have collections (in mongodb, which is a similar to schema in relational DBMS (such as SQL) a little bit), 

I don't have newest schema, which is stored at this directory. 

I only have an older schema, which is placed in older HW (HW2), which is also stored at Github.
